# SensESP Smart Switches

This project is used to compile SensESP smart switch firmware to an ESPxx powered device with power control via relays or MOSFETs

Loading this project into PlatformIO, there are five different devices that this project can be built for:

1. sonoff4ch
1. shelly1
1. shelly25
1. m5stick-c
1. common_sense_d1_mini

Once opened in PlatformIO, go to the "Project Tasks" tab (the icon with the alien face), drop down the device you are building for, and select "Build", "Upload", or "Upload and Monitor".
